 Introduction
## Technology stack
I'll use a microservices architecture to build WIE from the start.

I'll use `golang` as the foundational software, with `Fiber` as the platform to handle HTTP calls.

I'll use `html/template`, `HTMX` and `Hyperscript` to render the UI on the server, precluding the requirement for a complex tech stack to support the user experience.
