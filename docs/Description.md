# Introduction
Our clients installations are located in remote areas without access to goods and services available in general locations. Hence, they operate a mercantile at their locations providing the goods and services demanded by their collaborators. During their `tours` working on location, these collaborators `work` to earn `income` either `local` our `hard` (gold) `currency`, and `expense` these earnings to purchase goods and services at our clients' mercantiles.

Our clients use WIE to to account for their collaboratores income and expenses while on location and to ensure a smooth closing of the collaborators' accounts at the end of their tours.
